# Listing Service - EBOY

Eboy (definitely not ebay.)- program created to simulate a basic listing service.

### packages used
* Node express
* EJS
* body-parser

### What I have learned
* Create a simple form with the action attribute and method to send data to the server.
* Create a server with routes.
* Organising files to folders accordingly to work standards.
* Learnt about using bodyparser middleware to access POST handler from form.
* Constant checking and console.logging to make sure every code is working.
* Installed and used bodyparser

### What challenges I overcame
* Breaking down the project brief via drawio.
* Setting up work flow so everything is ready for git, node, installations etc.
* Serving my index.html file as the homepage.
* Serving another file to output data from form.
* Styling the results page with minimal code to maintain concept, colour scheme and display data output.

### What I struggled with
* Learn and implement EJS.
* Accessing POST handler from form.


### What I would do differently next time
* To git commit regularly and meaningfully.
* Implement front end JS functionality (ie.forms must be completed before being submitted.)
* Improve on designing and learn more about UI.
* Added a feature where back button allows to edit previous information.
* Take regular breaks to avoid burn out.
